        <p>Hi — I’m Bernard. I build fast, reliable sites and systems with a focus on clean design, great UX, and boringly solid infra.</p>
        <p>I run <strong>Greenberry</strong>, make tools for real-world teams, and occasionally write about tech, process, and music.</p>
        <p>On this site you’ll find blog posts, project notes, and an archive of experiments. Everything runs on Astro + Tailwind with a modern–retro UI kit I’ve been refining.</p>
