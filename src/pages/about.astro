          <h2>The Story</h2>
          <div class="prose">
            <p>
              I'm Bernard, originally from Meath but based in Dublin these days. I've been
              messing about with computers since I was young enough to not know any better,
              and somehow turned that into a career.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the day, I work as an IT Administrator, helping businesses keep their
              technology running without wanting to throw it out the window. It's a mix of
              Microsoft 365 administration, Azure cloud services, and general "the printer
              isn't working" support.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of that, I build websites and web applications. I started
              <a href="/projects/greenberry">Greenberry</a> to help Irish small businesses
              get online without being ripped off. There's a lot of overpriced, overcomplicated
              solutions out there, and I thought I could do better. The jury's still out on
              whether I was right.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've a particular interest in using tech for good. Whether it's helping a
              parish get their website sorted, building tools for community groups, or just
              lending a hand to someone doing something worthwhile, that's the work that
              gets me out of bed. Well, that and the mortgage.

            to argue about The Cure's best album (it's <em>Disintegration</em>, by the way),
            I'm happy to hear from you.

          <p>
            I'm particularly interested in hearing from community groups, charities, or
            anyone doing something good who needs a hand with technology.
