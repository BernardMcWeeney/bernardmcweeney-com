  title: The Story
  paragraphs:
    - I'm Bernard, originally from Meath but based in Dublin these days. I've been messing about with computers since I was young enough to not know any better, and somehow turned that into a career.
    - During the day, I work as an IT Administrator, helping businesses keep their technology running without wanting to throw it out the window. It's a mix of Microsoft 365 administration, Azure cloud services, and general "the printer isn't working" support.
    - "Outside of that, I build websites and web applications. I started Greenberry to help Irish small businesses get online without being ripped off. There's a lot of overpriced, overcomplicated solutions out there, and I thought I could do better. The jury's still out on whether I was right."
    - I've a particular interest in using tech for good. Whether it's helping a parish get their website sorted, building tools for community groups, or just lending a hand to someone doing something worthwhile, that's the work that gets me out of bed. Well, that and the mortgage.
