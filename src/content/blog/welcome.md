Welcome to my blog! I'm Bernard McWeeney, an IT Administrator and Web Developer based in Dublin, Ireland.

## What to Expect

I'll be sharing my experiences and insights on:

- **Web Development** - Building modern websites with Astro, React, and other frameworks
- **IT Infrastructure** - Managing Microsoft 365, Azure, and enterprise systems
- **Automation** - PowerShell scripts, APIs, and workflow automation
- **Tech Discoveries** - Interesting tools and technologies I come across

## Why Start a Blog?

Writing helps me organize my thoughts and document solutions to problems I've solved. If my posts help even one other developer or IT admin, that's a win.

Stay tuned for more content!
