## What It Is

Clubify is a concept for bringing the same approach I use with parishes to sports clubs and community organisations.

GAA clubs, soccer clubs, community groups - they all face similar challenges. They need websites, membership management, communication tools, maybe event ticketing or fundraising platforms. And they're usually run by volunteers who have day jobs and families.

## The Problem

Most clubs either:
- Have no digital presence at all
- Have a website from 2010 that nobody knows how to update
- Got sold an expensive platform they don't fully use
- Rely entirely on Facebook, which they don't control

There's a gap for simple, affordable, maintainable solutions.

## The Vision

Repeatable systems that can be deployed across multiple clubs:
- Clean, modern websites that volunteers can actually update
- Integrated membership and communication tools
- Event management and ticketing
- Fundraising and donation systems
- Email and basic IT setup

All designed for organisations where the "IT person" is whoever drew the short straw at the last committee meeting.

## Current Status

This is still in concept phase. The parish work proves the model works. Expanding it to clubs is the natural next step, but it needs proper time and attention to do right.
