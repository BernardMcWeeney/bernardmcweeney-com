## What This Is

A major consolidation project bringing approximately 100 site and centre domains under centralised management in Cloudflare.

## The Problem Before

Domains scattered across different registrars and DNS providers:
- Inconsistent security configurations
- No centralised visibility
- Configuration drift between sites
- Difficult incident response
- Duplicated effort managing similar things differently

## The Solution

**Centralised DNS Management**
All domains in one place. Consistent configurations, easy auditing, no "who manages this domain again?" conversations.

**Security Uplift**
- WAF (Web Application Firewall) protection across all properties
- DDoS mitigation
- Bot management
- Consistent security policies

**TLS and Certificate Strategy**
Proper certificate management instead of hoping individual sites remember to renew.

**Improved Visibility**
When something happens, we can see it. Traffic patterns, security events, performance issues — all visible in one place.

**Reduced Sprawl**
Fewer vendors, fewer configurations to maintain, fewer places for things to go wrong.

## The Impact

This wasn't a nice-to-have project. It materially improved the organisation's security posture:
- Attack surface reduction
- Faster incident detection and response
- Consistent protection regardless of which site
- Confidence in the DNS infrastructure

## The Work

Domain migrations aren't just "change the nameservers." It involves:
- Inventory and documentation
- Stakeholder communication
- Testing and validation
- Cutover planning
- Rollback preparation
- Post-migration verification

Multiply that by ~100 domains and it's a substantial coordination exercise.
