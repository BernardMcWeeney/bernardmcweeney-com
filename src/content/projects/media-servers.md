## What It Is

Self-hosted media and services running at home. Partly because it's useful, partly because it's interesting.

## The Stack

**Media**
- **Jellyfin** - Open-source media server (like Plex but without the account requirement)
- Various *arr applications for media management
- Storage on a NAS with proper redundancy

**Other Services**
- Various Docker containers for different purposes
- Reverse proxy for clean access
- Backup systems

## Why Bother

Streaming services are fragmented and expensive. Content disappears. Quality varies. And you're renting access, not owning anything.

Self-hosting media means:
- It's always available
- Quality is consistent
- No monthly fees (after initial setup)
- No content suddenly disappearing

But honestly, a big part of it is just enjoying running infrastructure. There's satisfaction in having systems that work the way you want them to.

## The Learning Value

Running this stuff teaches you:
- Docker and containerisation
- Networking and reverse proxies
- Storage and backups
- Linux administration
- Troubleshooting when things break at 11pm on a Sunday

Skills that transfer to professional work, learned while doing something enjoyable.

## The Honesty

Is this the most efficient use of time? Probably not. Could I just pay for streaming services? Sure. But where's the fun in that?

Sometimes you do things because they're interesting, not because they're optimal.
