## The Story

Greenberry started from a simple observation: plenty of great Irish businesses were being let down by overcomplicated, overpriced tech solutions. I'd seen local shops, tradies, and service providers struggle with websites that cost a fortune and did half of what they needed.

So I thought, why not do something about it?

## What We Do

It's fairly straightforward really. We build websites that work, set up IT systems that don't cause headaches, and provide support when things inevitably go sideways. Nothing fancy, just reliable tech that helps businesses get on with what they're actually good at.

### Services

- **Web Development** — Custom WordPress sites, React applications, and everything in between. Built to be fast, accessible, and easy to update.
- **IT Infrastructure** — Microsoft 365 setup and management, Azure cloud services, and general IT support.
- **Ongoing Support** — Because launching a website is only half the battle.

## The Technical Bits

For the curious:

- Sites are built on WordPress (for clients who want to manage their own content) or modern frameworks like Astro and React (for more complex needs)
- Hosting typically runs through Azure or Cloudflare, depending on the project
- Everything gets proper security, backups, and monitoring — the boring stuff that matters

## Lessons Learned

Running Greenberry has taught me a lot about working with people, not just code. Understanding what a business actually needs versus what they think they want is half the job. The other half is explaining technical decisions in plain English.

It's also shown me that you don't need to oversell yourself. Do good work, be reliable, and people will come back.
