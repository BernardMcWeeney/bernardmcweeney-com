## What It Is

BernardOnTheAux is my personal music writing space. Reviews, gig write-ups, listening notes, and whatever else I feel like writing about music. No algorithms deciding what gets seen. No engagement metrics. Just writing about music I care about.

## Why It Exists

I got tired of music discourse being reduced to hot takes on Twitter or algorithmic playlists telling me what I should like. There's something lost when everything has to be optimised for engagement.

This is the opposite of that. A personal blog where I can write a 2,000 word essay about why a particular B-side matters, and it doesn't need to perform for anyone.

## The Spirit

It's built in the spirit of early web culture. When people had personal sites about their interests, not personal brands. When you could stumble across someone's passionate writing about something obscure and it felt like finding treasure.

I'm not trying to be a music journalist. I'm just someone who listens to a lot of music and occasionally has thoughts worth writing down.

## How It's Built

Static site, minimal dependencies, fast loading. The kind of site that would have worked fine in 2005 and will probably still work in 2035. Content is just markdown files. No CMS, no database, no fuss.
