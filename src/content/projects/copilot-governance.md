## What This Is

Planning and execution of an organisational AI pilot. Introducing Copilot capabilities deliberately, with proper governance, rather than letting it spread uncontrolled.

## The Approach

AI in an enterprise environment isn't just "turn it on and see what happens." Especially in a public-sector context with sensitive data and compliance requirements.

**Controlled Rollout**
Starting with specific groups, specific use cases, specific expectations. Learning from real usage before expanding.

**Licensing Strategy**
Copilot licensing is expensive. Understanding what's actually needed versus what's nice to have. Scoping to where value is clearest.

**Data Protection Considerations**
Copilot can surface information in new ways. Information that was technically accessible but practically obscure might suddenly be easy to find. This requires:
- Review of information protection labels
- Understanding data exposure implications
- Ensuring appropriate access controls exist
- Thinking about what shouldn't be indexed

## Staff Guidance

Technology without guidance creates problems. This includes:
- Safe use expectations
- Understanding what Copilot can and can't do
- Privacy and confidentiality awareness
- Where it's appropriate vs where it isn't

## Evaluation

Measuring whether AI actually helps:
- Productivity impact
- Quality of outputs
- Risk incidents
- User satisfaction
- Cost vs benefit

The goal isn't AI adoption for its own sake. It's understanding whether this technology genuinely helps the organisation work better.

## The Philosophy

AI is powerful and potentially useful. It's also potentially problematic if deployed carelessly. The job is introducing it in a way that captures value while managing risk. That's governance, not excitement.
