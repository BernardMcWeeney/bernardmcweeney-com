## What It Is

Churchify is a focused offering for churches and parishes who need technology help but don't have technical expertise on tap.

Most parishes are run by volunteers. The priest is busy with, well, being a priest. Nobody has time to become an IT expert. But they still need a website, maybe live-streaming, probably online donations, and increasingly some basic digital infrastructure.

## What It Provides

- **Websites** - Simple, maintainable parish websites with Mass times, news, and contact information
- **Live Streaming** - Hardware and setup for streaming Masses to YouTube, designed for volunteer operation
- **Online Donations** - Secure giving through Stripe, supporting one-off and recurring contributions
- **Basic IT Support** - Help with email, accounts, and general technology questions

## The Philosophy

Churches are not tech companies. The technology should serve the mission, not become the mission.

Everything I build for parishes is designed with the assumption that a non-technical volunteer will have to maintain it. If it's too complicated for a 70-year-old sacristan to update, it's too complicated.

## Why This Exists

I've seen too many parishes get sold overcomplicated solutions by companies who don't understand the context. A parish doesn't need an enterprise CMS. They need something simple that works.

This is technology in service of community, not technology for its own sake.
