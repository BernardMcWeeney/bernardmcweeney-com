## Why This Exists

Parish websites are, to put it gently, often a bit behind the times. Many are stuck on outdated platforms, difficult to update, and missing features that communities actually need. Having worked with a few parishes through Greenberry, I kept running into the same problems.

Rather than solving them one-off each time, I figured it made sense to build something reusable.

## What It Does

Parish Core is a WordPress plugin that handles the specific needs of Catholic parishes:

- **Mass Times** — Easy-to-manage schedules that can handle regular masses, holy days, and special occasions
- **Event Calendar** — Parish events, sacramental preparation dates, fundraisers
- **Parish Information** — Contact details, staff directory, sacrament information
- **Newsletter Integration** — Keep parishioners informed without fighting with Mailchimp
- **Bulletins** — Upload weekly bulletins and keep an archive

## The Technical Approach

I'm building this with longevity in mind. Parishes often have limited tech resources, so the plugin needs to:

- Work reliably without constant maintenance
- Be simple enough for volunteers to manage
- Integrate with existing WordPress themes
- Not require a computer science degree to configure

The admin interface uses React for a more modern feel, but the public-facing output is lightweight and accessible.

## Current Status

Still in active development. I'm working with a couple of pilot parishes to refine the features and iron out the rough edges. The plan is to release it publicly once it's properly battle-tested.

If you're involved with a parish and this sounds useful, I'd love to hear from you.
