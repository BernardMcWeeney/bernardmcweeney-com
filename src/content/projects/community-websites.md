## What This Is

Over the years, I've built and maintained websites for parishes, schools, and community organisations across Ireland. This isn't one project - it's an ongoing body of work.

I'm not listing individual clients here. That's not the point. The point is the approach.

## The Approach

These organisations have specific needs:
- **Limited budgets** - They can't afford agency rates
- **Non-technical editors** - Whoever updates the site isn't a web developer
- **Long-term thinking** - They need something that works in five years, not just at launch
- **Accessibility** - Their audience includes everyone, including people who aren't comfortable with technology

Every site I build for these clients is designed with those realities in mind.

## What "Stewardship" Means

I don't just build sites and disappear. Many of these relationships are ongoing:
- Content migrations when platforms change
- Security updates and maintenance
- Training for new volunteers
- Advice when they're not sure what to do

This isn't glamorous work. It doesn't make for exciting case studies. But it matters to the people who rely on these sites.

## Why I Do It

Parish and community websites aren't going to win design awards. But they serve real purposes for real communities. Someone checking Mass times. A family looking for school enrollment information. A community group trying to reach their members.

That's worth doing well.
