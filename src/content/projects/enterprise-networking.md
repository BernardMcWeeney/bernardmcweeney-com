## What This Covers

Enterprise networking across a large, geographically distributed organisation. This isn't home networking or small-office deployments — it's coordinated infrastructure across 100+ sites.

## Cisco Meraki

The primary enterprise networking platform:

**Centralised Visibility**
Single dashboard view across all sites. Understanding what's connected, what's happening, where the problems are.

**Secure WAN Design**
Site-to-site connectivity, secure routing, appropriate traffic segmentation.

**Vendor Coordination**
Working with Meraki and resellers on support, troubleshooting, and upgrades. Enterprise networking means enterprise relationships.

**Cloud Integration**
Alignment with Entra ID, Intune, and the broader security strategy. Networks aren't isolated — they're part of the identity and security fabric.

## UniFi Deployments

For specific sites and use cases, UniFi infrastructure:

**Wi-Fi Optimisation**
RF tuning, channel planning, dealing with interference in challenging environments.

**VLAN and Segmentation**
Proper network separation — student devices, staff devices, IoT, guest access. Not everything should talk to everything else.

**Device Onboarding**
Secure device provisioning, 802.1X where appropriate, integration with identity systems.

**Surveillance Integration**
UniFi Protect for camera systems, keeping surveillance traffic properly isolated.

## Depth Beyond Dashboards

It's easy to click around vendor dashboards. The actual work is understanding what's happening underneath:
- Why is this access point performing poorly?
- What's causing the intermittent connectivity at site X?
- How do we segment this new device type safely?
- What happens when we upgrade and something breaks?

Experience with both Meraki and UniFi provides perspective on different approaches and trade-offs.
