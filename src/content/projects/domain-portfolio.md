## What It Is

I own too many domain names. This is documented so I can at least pretend it's a strategic asset rather than a hobby that's gotten out of hand.

## The Reality

Every developer has a domain graveyard - names bought with grand plans that never materialised. I have more than most. Some become real projects. Most sit there, quietly renewing, waiting for their moment.

## Why It Happens

A good domain name is hard to find. When you spot one that's available and fits an idea you might have someday, there's pressure to grab it before someone else does. At €10-15 a year, it feels low-risk.

Multiply that by years of "low-risk" purchases and suddenly you're spending real money maintaining optionality.

## The Justification

Some genuinely useful outcomes:
- Domains ready when projects actually launch
- Brand protection for active projects
- Testing ground for DNS and hosting experiments
- A few that have appreciated in value (theoretically - I've never sold one)

## The Honest Assessment

It's mostly an addiction. But a fairly harmless one in the grand scheme of things. Worse hobbies exist.

At least I know what I'm doing when I register yet another .ie domain at 2am because "this might be useful someday."

## Current Strategy

Actually trying to be more disciplined:
- Let domains expire if they're genuinely not going to be used
- Consolidate registrars for easier management
- Document what each domain is for (even if it's "no idea")
- Accept that some purchases were mistakes
