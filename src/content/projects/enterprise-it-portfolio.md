## What This Is

End-to-end ownership of a large public-sector Microsoft tenant. This isn't help desk work or button-clicking administration. This is tenant stewardship at scale.

**The numbers:**
- ~3,500 staff
- ~70,000 students
- 100+ sites
- Multi-domain management across schools, centres, and services

## What It Involves

This role spans everything that makes a large Microsoft environment actually work:

**Identity & Access** — Entra ID architecture, administrative units, RBAC, conditional access, lifecycle management for staff and students.

**Endpoint Management** — Intune at scale, Autopilot provisioning, compliance baselines, device security policies.

**Security & Compliance** — Defender for Endpoint, risk management, audit preparation, data protection operationalisation.

**Platform Services** — Azure governance, Cloudflare DNS and security, network integration.

**Governance & Risk** — Risk registers, go-live assurance, remediation tracking, GDPR compliance.

**Reporting & Visibility** — Power BI dashboards for licensing, costs, and executive decision-making.

**Automation** — PowerShell tooling for bulk operations, naming standards, audit exports.

## The Balance

Public-sector IT at this scale requires constant balancing:
- Central control vs site-level autonomy
- Security vs usability
- Standardisation vs legitimate exceptions
- Moving quickly vs not breaking things

Every decision affects thousands of people. That focuses the mind.

## Why This Matters

This work demonstrates:
- Comfort operating at enterprise and public-sector scale
- Understanding identity, security, networking, cloud, and governance as one interconnected system
- Ability to manage vendors, auditors, risk, and people
- Building structure where chaos would otherwise exist
- Introducing change without breaking trust

This is real IT management, not just "being good with Microsoft".
