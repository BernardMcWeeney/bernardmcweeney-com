## What It Is

Online donation systems for parishes that actually work for both the donor and the parish office.

## The Problem

Churches have historically relied on cash collections. That's increasingly problematic:
- Fewer people carry cash
- Visitors can't contribute easily
- No recurring giving option
- Cash handling and counting is time-consuming

But most online donation platforms aimed at churches are either expensive, complicated, or both.

## The Solution

Stripe-based donation systems integrated directly into parish websites:
- **One-off donations** - Simple form, card payment, done
- **Recurring giving** - Set up a monthly contribution
- **Multiple funds** - Support different collections (general, building, missions)
- **Low fees** - Stripe's standard rates, no additional platform fees
- **Simple reporting** - Easy export for the parish finance committee

## Why Stripe

Stripe is reliable, well-documented, and the fees are reasonable. It handles all the payment security and compliance. I don't need to worry about PCI compliance because Stripe does.

More importantly, it just works. Donors don't need to create accounts or remember passwords. The parish gets the money promptly.

## The Human Side

The technical implementation is straightforward. The harder part is helping parishes communicate the option to parishioners, especially older ones who might be hesitant about online payments.

Good copy on the donation page, reassurance about security, and sometimes printed instructions for those who need them.
