## The Plan

I've been a fan of The Cure since I first heard *Disintegration* as a teenager. There's something about their music that just gets better with time. Melancholy done right.

Most Cure fan sites are, let's say, showing their age. Built in the early 2000s and maintained sporadically at best. I'd love to build something that does the band justice — a proper archive with modern UX.

## Planned Features

- **Complete Discography** — Albums, singles, compilations, B-sides, the lot. With proper metadata and context.
- **Setlist Archive** — Historical setlists from tours going back decades. Useful for gig-goers wondering what to expect.
- **Song Database** — Every song, with lyrics, recording information, and live performance history.
- **Community Features** — A place for fans to share stories, concert memories, and rare recordings.

## Why "Cureation"?

Cure + Curation. It's a pun. I'm not sorry.

## Status

This one's on the backburner for now. I've got the domain and some initial designs, but it needs dedicated time to do properly. Maybe once Parish Core is released.

If you're a fellow Cure fan and want to help out, get in touch.
