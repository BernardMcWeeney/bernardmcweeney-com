## What This Is

When things go wrong in IT - security incidents, failed audits, compliance gaps - you need a structured way to fix them. Not just fixing the immediate problem, but demonstrating that you've fixed it properly and it won't happen again.

This work involves building frameworks for:
- **Security Remediation** - Tracking and resolving security findings from audits and assessments
- **Go-Live Assurance** - Structured checklists and sign-offs before major changes or launches
- **Risk Tracking** - Documenting risks, mitigations, and residual risk acceptance
- **Evidence Collection** - Gathering and organising proof of compliance for auditors

## Why It Matters

Nobody enjoys this work. It's not exciting. But it's essential when:
- External auditors need evidence of controls
- Insurance requires proof of security measures
- Regulators have questions
- Leadership needs confidence that systems are safe
- You need to prove to yourself that everything is actually sorted

## The Approach

Good frameworks are:
- **Specific enough** to be useful, not generic checklists
- **Trackable** - you can see progress and status at a glance
- **Auditable** - evidence is attached, not just claims
- **Sustainable** - people actually use them, not just at audit time

## The Output

This usually materialises as:
- Remediation trackers with owners, deadlines, and status
- Power BI dashboards showing security posture over time
- Go-live checklists for different types of changes
- Documentation templates that people will actually fill in
