## What It Is

Waymark is my IT consultancy brand. It's where the serious infrastructure and systems work lives, separate from web design and creative projects.

The name comes from waymarkers - those signs on trails that help you navigate. That's the job: helping organisations find their way through technology decisions without getting lost.

## What It Covers

- **Microsoft 365 & Azure** - Tenant architecture, governance, security configuration
- **Identity & Access** - Entra ID, conditional access, RBAC models
- **Device Management** - Intune, Autopilot, device compliance
- **Automation** - PowerShell tooling, reporting, process improvement
- **Strategy** - Helping organisations make sensible technology decisions

## Why Separate From Greenberry?

Greenberry is web design. Waymark is infrastructure. They're different disciplines, different conversations, different clients.

A parish website is a Greenberry conversation. Enterprise tenant security is a Waymark conversation. Mixing them up confuses everyone.

## The Approach

I'm not interested in selling technology for its own sake. The goal is always: what does this organisation actually need? What's the simplest solution that solves the problem? How do we set things up so they don't become a maintenance nightmare?

Good IT should disappear into the background. You shouldn't have to think about it constantly. That's the standard I work to.
