## What It Is

An experiment in scaling local SEO without resorting to the usual low-quality approach.

## The Problem With Most Local SEO

You've seen them. Pages that say "We provide [service] in [county]. Looking for [service] in [county]? We're the best [service] provider in [county]." Repeated for every county in Ireland with nothing useful actually on the page.

It's spam dressed up as content. Search engines are getting better at recognising it, and users certainly recognise it.

## The Experiment

Can you create genuinely useful, location-specific pages at scale? Pages that:
- Actually say something relevant about that location
- Provide information people might want
- Don't just keyword-stuff the county name
- Build trust rather than triggering "this is spam" instincts

## The Approach

- **Research actual local context** - What's different about doing business in Donegal vs Dublin? What do people in that area actually care about?
- **Write real content** - Not templates with placeholders, but content that makes sense for each location
- **Useful information** - Local resources, relevant considerations, genuine value
- **Automation where appropriate** - Systems to generate structure and pull data, but human oversight on the content

## Current Status

Still experimental. Building the systems, testing approaches, measuring results. The hypothesis is that quality scales better than quantity when you're competing for local search.

Whether it works remains to be seen. That's why it's an experiment.
