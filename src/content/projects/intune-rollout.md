## What This Is

Cloud-native endpoint management at enterprise scale. Moving from legacy on-premises management to Intune across tens of thousands of devices.

## Device Management

**Windows Autopilot**
Zero-touch provisioning with consistent naming standards. Devices arrive, get plugged in, and configure themselves correctly. No imaging, no technician time per device.

**Compliance Baselines**
Configuration policies that ensure devices meet security requirements. Health reporting, automatic remediation where possible, clear visibility into compliance state.

**Device Categorisation**
Ownership models, device types, organisational assignment. Preparing the foundation for future BYOD and multi-platform support.

## Endpoint Security

**Defender for Endpoint**
Not just antivirus — actual endpoint detection and response. Threat visibility, investigation capabilities, integration with the broader security stack.

**BitLocker Compliance**
Encryption everywhere, keys safely escrowed, compliance reporting for auditors.

**Attack Surface Reduction**
Hardening beyond the defaults. Reducing what can run, what can execute, what can be exploited.

**Security as a System**
These aren't separate products ticked off a list. They work together as a coherent security posture.

## The Scale

This isn't a pilot or a small deployment. We're talking tens of thousands of devices across 100+ sites. Every policy decision affects thousands of machines. Every misconfiguration creates thousands of problems.

At this scale, you learn to test thoroughly, roll out gradually, and have rollback plans ready.

## Legacy Transition

Part of this work is replacing what came before — legacy AV solutions, on-premises management tools, inconsistent configurations. You can't just switch everything off and turn on the new thing. It's careful, staged transition while keeping everything working.
