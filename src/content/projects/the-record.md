## What It Was

The Record was an ambitious attempt at building an independent digital journalism platform. The vision was a network of interconnected publications: therecord.ie for national news, northeastnews.ie for regional coverage, and various other sub-brands for specific beats.

## What I Learned

A lot, frankly. Mostly about the gap between ambition and sustainable execution.

Building a journalism operation requires resources I didn't have. Advertising revenue for small publishers is brutal. Subscription models need scale. And writing quality journalism while also doing everything else is a recipe for burnout.

The editorial architecture thinking was sound. The separation between national and local, between news and opinion. The technical infrastructure worked. But a one-person journalism operation competing for attention in a crowded media landscape? That was always going to be difficult.

## Why It's Archived

I narrowed my focus. Rather than trying to be a media company, I'm better off building things and occasionally writing about topics I actually know something about. The domains still exist. The thinking still informs how I approach content. But the active journalism project is on hold indefinitely.

## What Remains

The experience of building editorial systems, thinking about content architecture, and understanding the economics of digital publishing. All valuable, even if the project itself didn't survive.

Sometimes the best outcome of an ambitious project is knowing what not to attempt next time.
