## What It Is

Dowth.ie is a website dedicated to the history, archaeology, and mythology of Dowth passage tomb and the wider Boyne Valley in County Meath.

If you're not from around here, the Boyne Valley is home to some of the most significant Neolithic monuments in Europe. Newgrange gets all the tourists, but Dowth and Knowth are equally remarkable. And the whole landscape is layered with thousands of years of human history.

## Why It Exists

Most information about these sites is either academic papers (inaccessible to normal people) or tourism content (surface-level). There's a gap for something in between.

I grew up near Dowth. These places were just part of the landscape, taken for granted. The older I get, the more I appreciate what's on my doorstep. This site is my attempt to document and share that appreciation.

## The Approach

This isn't an academic project. I'm not an archaeologist. But I can research, synthesise, and write in a way that makes this material accessible without dumbing it down.

The design is deliberately calm and timeless. No flashy animations or trendy design patterns. The subject matter deserves respect, not gimmicks.

## Current State

Still in early development. There's a lot of research to do and content to write. This is a long-term project, not something to rush.
